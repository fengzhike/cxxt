        <div class="line level4">Welcome to Innovation Academy!</div>
        <div class="line level2">In order for you to create an account on Innovation Academy and use our services, we need to collect and process some information. Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:</div>

-->
        <div class="line level2">•information (such as your name, email and postal addresses, telephone number, and country of residence) that you provide by completing forms on Innovation Academy, including if you register as a user of the Services, subscribe to our newsletters, upload or submit any material through Innovation Academy, or request any information;</div>
        <div class="line level2">•your login and password details, in connection with the account sign-in process;</div>
        <div class="line level2">•details of any requests or transactions you make through the Services;</div>
        <div class="line level2">•information about your activity on and interaction with Innovation Academy, such as your IP address and the type of device or browser you use;</div>
        <div class="line level2">•communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem);</div>
        <div class="line level2">•information that you submit to Innovation Academy in the form of comments, contributions to discussions, or messages to other users.</div>
        <div class="line level1">This data will not be publicly displayed or revealed to other users:</div>
        <div class="line level2">•any payment information you provide</div>
        <div class="line level2">•your password details</div>
        <div class="line level2">•your IP address</div>

        <div class="line level1">We don’t give your personal information to any third-party services, except when it’s necessary to provide Innovation Academy’s Services (like when we partner with payment processors). When we share data with third-party services that support our delivery of the Innovation Academy Services, we require that they protect your personal information to the same standards we do.</div>
        <div class="line level1">We do reserve the right to disclose personal information when we believe that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or law enforcement, to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect Innovation Academy’s legal rights.</div>
        <div class="line level1">We may change these terms from time to time. If we do, we’ll let you know about any material changes, either by notifying you on the Site or by sending you an email. New versions of the terms will never apply retroactively — we’ll tell you the exact date they go into effect. If you keep using Innovation Academy after a change, that means you accept the new terms.</div>
        <div class="line level1">You can browse Innovation Academy without registering for an account. But to use some of Innovation Academy’s functions, you’ll need to register, choose an account name, and set a password. When you do that, the information you give us has to be accurate and complete. Don’t impersonate anyone else or choose names that are offensive or that violate anyone’s rights. If you don’t follow these rules, we may cancel your account.</div>
        <div class="line level1">You’re responsible for all the activity on your account, and for keeping your password confidential. If you find out that someone’s used your account without your permission, you should report it to</div>
        <div class="line level1">We expect all of them to behave responsibly and help keep this a nice place. Don’t do any of these things on the Site:</div>
        <div class="line level2">•<strong>Don’t break the law.</strong>Don’t take any action that infringes or violates other people’s rights, violates the law, or breaches any contract or legal duty you have toward anyone.</div>
        <div class="line level2">•Don’t lie to people. Don’t post information you know is false, misleading, or inaccurate. Don’t do anything deceptive or fraudulent.</div>
        <div class="line level2">•Don’t offer prohibited items. Don’t offer any rewards that are illegal, violate any of Innovation Academy’s policies, rules, or guidelines, or violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance, or regulation. </div>
        <div class="line level2">•Don’t victimize anyone. Don’t do anything threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, tortious, obscene, profane, or invasive of another person’s privacy.</div>
        <div class="line level2">•Don’t spam. Don’t distribute unsolicited or unauthorized advertising or promotional material, or any junk mail, spam, or chain letters. Don’t run mail lists, listservs, or any kind of auto-responder or spam on or through the Site.</div>
        <div class="line level2">•Don’t harm anyone’s computer. Don’t distribute software viruses, or anything else (code, films, programs) designed to interfere with the proper function of any software, hardware, or equipment on the Site (whether it belongs to Innovation Academy or another party).</div>
        <div class="line level2">•Don’t abuse other users’ personal information. When you use Innovation Academy — and especially if you create a successful project — you may receive information about other users, including things like their names, email addresses, and postal addresses. This information is provided for the purpose of participating in a Innovation Academy project: don’t use it for other purposes, and don’t abuse it.</div>
        <div class="line level2">•Don’t try to interfere with the proper workings of the Services.</div>
        <div class="line level2">•Don’t bypass any measures we’ve put in place to secure the Services.</div>
        <div class="line level2">•Don’t try to damage or get unauthorized access to any system, data, password, or other information, whether it belongs to Innovation Academy or another party.</div>
        <div class="line level2">•Don’t take any action that imposes an unreasonable load on our infrastructure, or on our third-party providers. (We reserve the right to determine what’s reasonable.)</div>
        <div class="line level2">•Don’t use any kind of software or device (whether it’s manual or automated) to “crawl” or “spider” any part of the Site.</div>
        <div class="line level2">•Don’t take apart or reverse engineer any aspect of Innovation Academy in an effort to access things like source code, underlying ideas, or algorithms.</div>
        <div class="line level1">Innovation Academy may contain links to other websites. (For instance, project pages, user profiles, and comments may link to other sites.) When you access third-party websites, you do so at your own risk. We don’t control or endorse those sites.</div>
